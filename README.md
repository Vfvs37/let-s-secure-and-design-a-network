**PROJECT PURPOSE**
Your company faces a thrilling task: devising a secure and efficient network solution for a client transitioning to a new office space. Their current infrastructure is in need of an upgrade, and your objective is to develop a cost-effective plan that maximizes resource utilization while prioritizing stringent security measures.

iSCSI, short for Internet Small Computer System Interface, serves as a protocol for establishing and managing connections between various storage devices, such as disk arrays or tape drives, over an IP network. It enables the seamless remote access and utilization of storage resources as if they were locally connected.

Within Packet Tracer, a renowned network simulation tool, the representation of an iSCSI storage server typically manifests through either a generic server device or a storage device equipped with iSCSI support. While the tool may lack a dedicated icon for this purpose, configuring a device to function as an iSCSI storage server involves enabling the relevant iSCSI services and appropriately configuring storage resources. It's worth noting that Packet Tracer may not offer intricate representations of all server types or protocols, yet it serves as a valuable platform for conducting fundamental network simulations.


**POJECT REQUIREMENT**
* DHCP server
* iSCSI server
* Active Directory and DNS server
* DMZ concept (through VLANs and ACLs)
* Four network sectors :
     - Management/Secretariat (5 workstations)
     - Study (8 workstations)
     - Production (10 workstations)
     - Support (2 sectors, 10 workstations each)




**TIME LINE**
* Plan's choices
* Elements placement
* Wiring
* Switches config
* Multylayers config
* Routeurs config
* VLANS config
* ACL config
* SSH/RSA config
* DCHP/DNS/RADIUS config
*Final project
*Final project presentation
*Final project report


***SECURITY***

**SECURITY FEATURE**
(Elements = purpose)
- line console 0 = Secures and manages a cisco device
- No IP domain lookup = Prevents infos leakage, allows mistyped stuff to be treated as errors, reduces attack surface
- NAT = Provides a level of security by hiding the internal Ip adress of device on the local network from external sources making it more difficult for attackers to directly target individual devices
- DMZ =  network design strategy that involves creating a buffer zone between an organization's internal network (trusted network) and external untrusted networks, such as the internet

name of the group: Insomniac Company
